# Compilation of the I-ADOPT glossary for internal communication
This repository is used to propose, discuss and compile common terminology to be used consistently during the first phase of the project. We don't mean here the terminology which will be proposed for the Interoperability Framework, as this has to be decided after the collection and analysis phase of the I-ADOPT work plan.
Terms can be proposed as new issues, discussed and closed once consensus is reached. Labels can be used to keep track of term status.

One set of relevant terms and definitions (for use case analysis) is at https://github.com/i-adopt/usecase_analysis/blob/master/UCG.csv.
